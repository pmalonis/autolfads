1. Create a directory in which you clone the cloud branches of the lfadslite and PBT repo
2. In the same directory, place the Dockerfile
3. If you want to create the image with the same name then remove the previous version of the image  - "sudo docker rmi -f d68342b9ba87" (The alpha-numeric code is the image id which can be looked up by "sudo docker image ls")
4. Build the new image - "sudo docker build -t autolfads ." autolfads is the image name but it could be anything
5. Login into the docker account (I can share the credentials if you don't have them already but I think it should be on lab wiki) -  "sudo docker login"
6. Tag the new image "sudo docker tag e355503d7ac0 snelbeta/autolfads:some_id". The new image will have an id (e355503d7ac0) which can be checked from the printed details. Another way to check the image details is by using "sudo docker image ls"
7. Push the docker image - "sudo docker push snelbeta/autolfads"
